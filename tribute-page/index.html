          <p id="author-intro">Author <a href="http://margotleeshetterly.com/about/">Margot Lee Shetterly</a> describes the difference between <a href="http://margotleeshetterly.com/hidden-figures-nasas-african-american-computers/">her perception of what a scientist is</a>            and contemporary attitudes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>We all know what a scientist looks like: a wild-eyed person in a white lab coat and utilitarian eyeglasses, wearing a pocket protector and holding a test tube. Mostly male. Usually white. Even Google, our hive mind, confirms the prevailing
              view. Just do an image search for the word “scientist”.</p>

            <p>For me, growing up in Hampton, Virginia, the face of science was brown like mine. ... As a child, ... I knew so many African-Americans working in science, math and engineering that I thought that’s just what black folks did.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Her book will describe the women, human computing, the NACA and NASA, Civil Rights, and gender equality during this time, sharing their impact and working to redefine our vision of what a scientist looks like.
